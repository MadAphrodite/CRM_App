#### Highlights:
* During this project I gained experience and knowledge of API testing, creating test cases for API and executing different requests using Postman.
* As a result of taking on additional responsibilities due to team member’s absence, I gained more experience with API testing and developed my skills in collaboration, communication and time management.
* I reported 23 out of 51 bugs in a team of 5.
* I created 61 API requests.
* I wrote 13 test cases as well as 3 complex flow test cases.
* Upon reviewing my team’s work, I identified a misunderstanding regarding the use of the PATCH request and its distinction from the PUT request. I provided relevant learning materials to the team and assisted in correcting the requests to ensure the project's accuracy, success, and timely completion. 
* While running the complete Postman collection for our team, I identified multiple test failures due to incorrect endpoints. I immediately reached out to the team and together, we successfully resolved the issues within the established timeline.
